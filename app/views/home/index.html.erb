<h1>Welcome to BlogEase</h1>
<p>This is a simple blogging application I made to show my proficiency with Ruby on Rails. I'm using Bootstrap for the styling and a polymorphic association on the comment model so that you can comment on comments. Feel free to hit "Log In" up in the navbar, and either make an account or use the guest pass to try out making a post or commenting.</p>
